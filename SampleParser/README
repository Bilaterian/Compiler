  To build the parser, type "make" in the current directory, which will 
generate an executable program called "CM".

  To test source code like "fac.cm", type 

    "java -cp /usr/share/java/cup.jar:. CM fac.cm -c" 

and the tm output will be shown on screen.

  To rebuild the parser, type "make clean" and type "make" again.

	Aside from the java files in absyn that do not share a name with the 
ones found in the sample package, we recognize that all files here 
were taken from the sample package and were modified to fit the 
checkpoint's requirements.
