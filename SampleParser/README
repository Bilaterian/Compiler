  To build the parser, type "make" in the current directory, which will 
generate an executable program called "CM".

<<<<<<< HEAD
To test you can use 
    "java -cp /usr/share/java/cup.jar:. CM fac.cm" 
along side a flag -s , -a , or -c
i.e
    "java -cp /usr/share/java/cup.jar:. CM fac.cm -c" 

When you use -c 
you can run make it generates a .tm file that you can run by using the TurningMachine simulator
make that and then run the file along side with it
i.e 
"/tm fac.tm"
and the enter g to exucute 
=======
  To test source code like "fac.cm", type 

    "java -cp /usr/share/java/cup.jar:. CM fac.cm -c" 

and the tm output will be shown on screen.

  To rebuild the parser, type "make clean" and type "make" again.

	Aside from the java files in absyn that do not share a name with the 
ones found in the sample package, we recognize that all files here 
were taken from the sample package and were modified to fit the 
checkpoint's requirements.
