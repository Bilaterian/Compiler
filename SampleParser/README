  To build the parser, type "make" in the current directory, which will 
generate an executable program called "CM".

To test you can use 
    "java -cp /usr/share/java/cup.jar:. CM fac.cm" 
along side a flag -s , -a , or -c
i.e
    "java -cp /usr/share/java/cup.jar:. CM fac.cm -c" 

When you use -c 
you can run make it generates a .tm file that you can run by using the TurningMachine simulator
make that and then run the file along side with it
i.e 
"/tm fac.tm"
and the enter g to exucute
